#  Welcome to the Hutspot Documentation
Hutspot is a Spotify controller for Sailfish-OS. You can browse/search albums, artists, playlists and tracks. Playing is done on an 'connect' device. It requires a premium Spotify account.

### Librespot on Sailfish
Playing music on your phone can be done using [Librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/), an open source Spotify player. 
Hutspot has some options in it's Settings page to integrate the Librespot service. For example Start/Stop and Register Credentials.

### Development
Sources of Hutspot can be found on [github](https://github.com/sailfish-spotify/hutspot).
Development is done using the Sailfish OS IDE. Most sources are QML and Javascript. Some part is done in C++.

Hutspot is being built on [OBS](http://repo.merproject.org/obs/home:/wdehoog:/hutspot/sailfish_latest_armv7hl/). See [Installation](/installation) on how to install it.

Due to the issues with detecting Spotify capable players this app is not 'plug and play'. Don't use it unless you are willing to mess around.

Sorry but we do not accept any donations. We do appreciate the gesture but it is a hobby that we are able to do because others are investing their time as well.

If someone wants to show appreciation for our work by a donation then we suggest to help support openrepos.net.
